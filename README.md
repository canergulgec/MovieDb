### Configuration

In order to use MovieDB:
- You need to get API KEY from TMDb. You can do that by clicking [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup).
- Once you obtain key, create `secure.properties` which should be on the same level with build.gradle(Project:MovieDb)
- Add your key into secure.properties `MOVIE_API_KEY = "xxx" `

### Modules

Modules are the collection of source files and build settings that allow you to divide your project into discrete units of functionality.

- **App Module**

  `:app` module is an [com.android.application](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library), which is needed to create the app bundle. It presents data to a screen and handle user interactions.

- **Base Module**

  `:base` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library), contains only base classes that is used in other modules

- **Common Module**

  `:common` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library), contains code and resources which are shared between other modules

- **Data Module**

  `:data` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library), contains models and utility classes such as [DiffUtil](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/DiffUtil)

- **Domain Module**

  `:domain` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library), that retrieves data from network calls and provides data source for the many features that requires it.

- **Presentation Module**

  `:presentation` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library), contains business logic and adapter classes

### Architecture

- [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel)(MVVM) pattern helps to completely separate the business and presentation logic from the UI
- `Modular app architecture` enables separate functionality into independent, interchangeable modules
- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable

### Code style

To maintain the style and quality of the code
